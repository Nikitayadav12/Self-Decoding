👽 Alien Message Decoder
Welcome to the Alien Message Decoder project! This notebook is based on a fictional scenario where the SETI Institute receives encrypted signals from an alien civilization. The aim is to decode and understand their messages using Python.

📚 Project Overview
The SETI Institute received a tuple of encrypted strings from space. Scientists discovered a pattern — each string's length corresponds to a character (with 0 meaning a space, 1 = A, 2 = B, ..., 26 = Z). This notebook walks through the decoding process and even helps generate encrypted responses back to the aliens!

🧠 Key Concepts
Mapping string lengths to alphabet characters

Handling spaces (represented as empty strings)

Creating and reversing dictionaries

Encrypting human messages into alien format

Decoding jumbled words by sorting letters

🛠️ Features
✅ Decrypt alien messages using string length logic

✅ Build custom alphabet dictionaries (including space as 0)

✅ Find keys from values in the dictionary

✅ Encode messages like "why" to send back to aliens

✅ Decode alien jumbled words using string sorting

📷 Sample Output
Alien Message:
("ajsuydtbe", "", "wunjbfusnjrgut", "uhbhr", "oirun", "lpef", "", "vhejsibr", "ydtse", "qlvuusrntuos", "ijwlbutybhlsoaxh")
Decoded Output:

🌌 Inspiration
This project is inspired by SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) and popular science-fiction concepts, blending coding with creativity to decode imagined alien languages.
